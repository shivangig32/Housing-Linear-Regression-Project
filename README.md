# Housing Linear Regression Project

## Objective
The goal of this project is to implement and understand simple and multiple linear regression models using a housing dataset.

## Dataset
- Dataset: Housing.csv
- Attributes include area, bedrooms, bathrooms, furnishing status, and more.

## Steps Performed
1. Imported and explored the dataset.
2. Checked for missing values.
3. Preprocessed categorical variables using one-hot encoding.
4. Defined features (X) and target variable (y).
5. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
6. Trained a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn.
7. Predicted the target values for the test set.
8. Evaluated the model using MAE, MSE, and RÂ² score.
9. Plotted Actual vs Predicted values.
10. Interpreted the model coefficients.

## Results
- Model evaluation metrics were calculated.
- Coefficients were analyzed to understand feature importance.
- A scatter plot was used to visualize model predictions.

## Conclusion
This project helped in understanding how linear regression works, how to evaluate regression models, and how to interpret the results.
